# mentor-group-project
A small React project with my mentor group

## What is the aim of the project?
The aim of the project is to allow you to practice these skills before the main project:
- working as a team
- working collaboratively with Git
- using Github issues and pull requests to manage the project in a good way
- practice putting together a React project from scratch
- creating a basic project that can be improved upon

## Rules of the project
We'll be using issues on Github to raise issues and features that need fixing or creating. This way, people can assign themselves to certain tasks. During the project, please don't try to work on somebody else's issue unless you get asked to help them.

When you complete a task, make a pull request to the develop branch. At least one other team member should test the feature and then approve it to be merged. This person does not have to be the mentor. It can be anyone in the team apart from the person who wrote the code. Every time we complete a stage, the mentor will merge the develop branch into the master branch.

## Suggested workflow
You might find it easiest to:
1. fork this repo
2. pull a local version to your machine
3. push changes back to your forked repo
4. create your pull request from your forked repo to the develop branch here :)

## What are the stages of the project?
To help, here are some user stories for the project. User stories are features and functions the project should include, but you will have freedom on how to actually make these user stories happen.

# Stage 1
You are going to build a water tracker app :D It's basic functionality should be:
- There should be basic content on the page including a header, footer, a basic tracking system e.g. input, instructions on how to use the tracker
- The project should be split into at least four components, including the App.js file
- It should meet basic accessibility needs e.g. colour contrast should be readable, no header stepping, semantic HTML where possible

# Stage 2
- The tracker should be functional in terms of taking input and showing output
- The user should be able to put in how much water they drank, as well as how much water they need to drink. They then should be able to see thier progress somehow.
- If not already completed in stage 1, we should have full CSS on the project e.g. a colour scheme, consistent fonts, etc.
- Accessibility checks

# Stage 3 
- Our tracking data should persist (be 'saved' somehow). We might try to implement a database solution later in the course, but there are other ways we can do it e.g. JSON, local storage

# Stage 4
- We can add extra features like allowing users to choose to track something that is not water or giving advice on how much water they need to drink for the day
